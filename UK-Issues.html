                 <li>Agriculture accounts for 70% of land in the UK, this has caused many bird and insect species to lose natural woodland habitats</li>
                 <li>Around 42% of nearly 700 bird, mammal, butterfly and moth species have dropped in numbers since 1970</li>
                 <li>One in 7 of the species mentioned above are at risk of going extinct</li>
                 <li>The National Trust has committed to creating 61,776 acres of new habitats by 2025</li>
                 <li>A simple nature pond in your garden can become a diverse habitat for endagered newt species and frogs</li>
                 <li>By recording species you see you can greatly help the conservationists learn where and who needs the most help</li>

             <p>If you have a garden or frequent grassy woodland areas taking pictures greatly helps, these images will be checked by experts and be available to researchers. </p>
