### Background

This website is being made to make people aware of habitat and biodiversity loss. By showing the issue I hope to highlight how detrimental to our future the destruction of land can be. I plan to mainly focus on British wildlife as it hits closer to home and makes sense for the project however there will be mention of international issues also.
