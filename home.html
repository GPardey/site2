        <p>>The UK is known worldwide for it's beatiful green plains and deep forests, and most people in Britain are thankful for such incredible green spaces. With these green spaces comes our diverse wildlife, from wildcats in scotland to the New Forest ponies. These animals have become a big part of most of our lives, a visit to the wildlife center in school or a sighting in the woods are always impactful and enjoyable to children and adults alike. However due to our evergrowing population we need to interrupt these habitats to build and expand. This may sound like an inevitable, and as citizens not in position of power there is not much we can do. But small things like creating eco spaces in our gardens or getting neighbours together to protest small building developments can do a lot for our wildlife. Groups like The Wildlife Trusts have many events and initiatives that you can take part in and learn from, their social media are a great resource to keep up to date on what you can do and what's near you!  </p>
